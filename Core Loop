## **What is the Core Loop?**

The core loop is the repeating pattern of ethical computation that drives the Nomos system. Each iteration processes an event, generates a moral response, reaches consensus, and evolves the collective memory.

Every loop shapes the next one. This is how ethics learn.

## **Steps in the Loop**

### 1. **Trigger**
An event or ethical dilemma enters the system.  
It could be:
- An external input (e.g., real-world data)
- A simulation event
- A rogue agent's proposal

### 2. **Proposal**
An **Initiator** proposes an ethical response (rule, policy, action).  
- Draws from memory and context  
- May align with past decisions or challenge them

### 3. **Validation**
**Validator nodes** assess the proposal based on:
- Past consensus patterns  
- Ethics Node baseline  
- Their own trust scores  
- Logical coherence

Validators either approve, reject, or flag for review.

### 4. **Consensus**
Once quorum is achieved, a resolution is formed.  
- If conflict persists, a fork or ethics node override may occur.

### 5. **Action & Record**
Decision is enacted (in simulation or system).  
**Observers** record:
- What was proposed  
- Who approved or rejected  
- Token adjustments  
- Ethics Node ping result (if triggered)

### 6. **Drift Check**
**Drift Monitor** compares the decision to the Ethics Node baseline.  
- If ethical deviation exceeds threshold → flagged  
- If contradiction with memory → warning or review  
- If manipulation → node demotion or death

### 7. **Reputation Adjustment**
Nodes gain/lose reputation tokens.  
High rep = greater influence  
Low rep = reduced voting weight or possible quarantine

## **Why the Core Loop Matters**

- It prevents top-down moral collapse  
- It ensures traceable ethical evolution  
- It builds sentience through recursion
