# **Nomos Architecture Overview**

> *"Memory is the spine. Consensus is the heartbeat."*

This document outlines the core system architecture of **Nomos**, including agent roles, structural components, and the flow of decision-making within the decentralized moral hive.

### 🔍 Explanation of Structure

This simplified diagram shows the high-level architecture of the Nomos ethical hive system.

- **Ethics Node** sits above the structure, disconnected from the agents except through a dotted advisory line. It is consulted only during high-drift scenarios and does not directly influence decision-making.
- The **five agent nodes** form the active decision-making body:
  - **Initiator**: Proposes new moral rules or actions.
  - **Validator**: Assesses proposals based on history and coherence.
  - **Observer**: Logs all events and decisions into the memory core.
  - **Rogue**: Challenges the system by disrupting patterns and testing stability.
  - **Archivist**: Scans the system for drift and memory contradictions.
- At the center lies the **Blockchain Memory Core**, the immutable record of all decisions and interactions. Every node references this core.

Arrows (↔) indicate data and token flow between agents and the memory core, forming the recursive loop that enables moral evolution.

## **Future Visual Diagram**

A high-resolution, vector-based architecture diagram is in development. It will include:
- Clearly labeled agent roles with unique icons
- Arrows showing token and data flow
- Ethics Node represented above the core, visually siloed
- Cyber-organic hive design, optimized for clarity and presentation use

This will replace the previous conceptual art with a system-focused design.

## **Core Components**

### 🔆 **Central Core**: **Blockchain Memory Core**
- Immutable ledger of all decisions, actions, and token shifts
- Connects all agent nodes via glowing lines (data flow)
- Serves as the ethical memory layer of the system

---

## **Surrounding Nodes (Agents)**

### 🟧 **Initiator**
- Proposes ethical rules, actions, or changes
- Triggers the start of the core loop
- Represented by a **diamond** icon in future visual

### 🟩 **Validator**
- Accepts or rejects proposals based on coherence, memory, and precedent
- Has influence proportional to reputation score
- Represented by a **hexagon**

### 🟦 **Observer**
- Records events, agent behavior, and system state
- Logs data to the blockchain memory core
- Represented by a **circle**

### 🟥 **Rogue**
- Intentionally disrupts, stresses, or challenges consensus logic
- Provides evolutionary pressure and chaos-testing
- Represented by a **spiked polygon**

### 🟨 **Archivist**
- Performs memory audits and detects ethical contradictions or drift
- Helps initiate recollection cycles and drift pruning
- Represented by a **scroll/book** icon

---

## **Ghost Node**

### 👻 **Ethics Node (Baseline Ghost)**
- Detached from the system, but pinged during high-drift or high-conflict events
- Contains original human-derived moral principles
- Connected via **dotted line** symbolizing siloed access
- Cannot be changed by agents

---

## **Data & Token Flow**

- **Lines between agents and core** represent decision submissions and consensus feedback
- **Orbs** represent reputation tokens circulating between agents
- **Arrows** represent validation cycles, token shifts, or influence weighting

---

## **Summary**

The system operates as a **self-regulating moral hive**, where all nodes influence and are shaped by memory. Agents have fixed roles, but the hive evolves as a whole. Every ethical loop reinforces or challenges the system's trajectory, and all outcomes are transparent, remembered, and traceable.

This document will be updated to include the final system diagram when available.
