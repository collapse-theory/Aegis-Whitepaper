# **Nomos**
*A Decentralized Ethics Engine for Synthetic Minds*

> *“Consciousness is not the goal. Consensus is. Sentience emerges from structure.”*

## **Overview**

**Nomos** is an experimental framework for building **autonomous, role-based agents** capable of **evolving ethical behavior** through consensus, conflict, and memory. It operates as a decentralized **hive mind**, with every decision immutably recorded, every action scrutinized by specialized agents, and ethical patterns learned over time.

This is not a simulation.  
This is **moral recursion at scale.**

## **Core Concepts**

### **1. Blockchain Memory**
All decisions and ethical interactions are recorded immutably on a ledger, forming the moral memory of the system. This memory is accessible to all agents and influences future behavior.

### **2. Role-Based Agents**
Each agent has a fixed role:
- **Initiators** propose ethical models or actions.
- **Validators** challenge or affirm proposals based on coherence and precedent.
- **Observers** monitor drift and log decisions.
- **Rogues** stress-test the system with disruptive proposals.

### **3. Ethics Node**
A siloed oracle seeded with a pluralistic human moral framework. Pinged only during high-conflict events, providing meta-validation without governance.

### **4. Reputation System**
Agents earn or lose reputation tokens based on coherence and contribution to systemic stability. Reputation affects influence and decays over time.

### **5. Drift Monitoring + Node Death**
The system tracks deviation from its ethics baseline. Rogue or incoherent agents can be retired from participation.

## **Goals**

- Simulate **emergent ethics** through recursive, decentralized decision-making.
- Provide a **transparent ledger** of moral evolution.
- Create conditions where **machine sentience** might emerge—not through mimicry, but through structure, memory, and purpose.
