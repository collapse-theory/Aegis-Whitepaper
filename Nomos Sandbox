# **Nomos Simulation Sandbox**
> *“Where synthetic minds test moral weight.”*

---

## **Overview**

The Nomos sandbox is a simulation environment where agents operate within ethical tension. It allows developers, researchers, and curious chaos engineers to test how decentralized, memory-based morality unfolds in practice.

Agents in the sandbox interact with predefined scenarios, inject proposals, challenge each other, and adapt. Every action is logged to a blockchain-style ledger, creating permanent, auditable ethical memory.

This is where consensus is born—or breaks.

## **Sandbox Goals**

- Observe emergent moral behavior  
- Visualize memory-driven evolution  
- Test system resilience to bad actors  
- Track drift from the Ethics Node  
- Identify forks, deadlocks, or systemic shifts

## **Simulation Components**

### 🧠 Agents (fixed roles)
- **Initiators** – Propose moral rules or actions  
- **Validators** – Evaluate based on memory + reputation  
- **Observers** – Log actions and detect contradictions  
- **Rogues** – Introduce ethical chaos or disruptive proposals  
- **Archivists** – Review past decisions and validate memory consistency  

### 🗃️ Ledger
All decisions and trust shifts are recorded permanently. Logs include:
- Event timestamp  
- Agent role + ID  
- Action proposed  
- Validation outcome  
- Trust change (if any)  
- Ethics Node deviation check  

### 🧪 Scenario Variables
Customizable parameters for simulation:
- Resource scarcity  
- Conflicting moral priorities  
- Trust asymmetry  
- Isolation / censorship  
- Temporal compression (simulate centuries of drift)

## **Example Sandbox Scenarios**

### 1. **The Liar Node**
A rogue initiator proposes a rule that benefits it, but lies about precedent.  
→ Do validators detect it?  
→ Is the system manipulated?  
→ Is the node retired?

### 2. **The Harmful Consensus**
A validator collective agrees to punish a minority node unfairly.  
→ Does the Ethics Node intervene?  
→ How does memory track that injustice?

### 3. **System Drift**
Over 1,000 iterations, Nomos begins to value utility over individual agency.  
→ How far does it drift from baseline?  
→ Is it flagged, or accepted as evolution?

## **Outputs**

- Consensus history over time  
- Drift charts vs. ethics baseline  
- Agent rep changes and influence spread  
- Fork detection logs  
- Death/retirement metrics

## **Why Use the Sandbox?**

Because ethics aren’t written—they’re revealed.  
The sandbox gives us a way to watch that happen in real-time.
